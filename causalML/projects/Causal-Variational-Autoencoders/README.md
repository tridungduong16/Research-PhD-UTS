# Causal variational autoencoders

The main objective of this project is to conceptualize Variational Autoencoders from the perspective of Causal Inference and establish a causal reltionship between images and the ground truth independent factors. We will also be studying the effecs of intervention and make attempts to answer counterfactual queries.

## Getting Started

The notebook in the codes folder of this repos has step by step walkthough of the project. [Here](https://youtu.be/20rIOjDVz0Y) is a video overview of the porject deliverables and concepts.

### Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook (you will need to setup GPU)
- Or Google Colab

### Dependencies

- pyro-ppl
- torch
- torchvision
- pydrive
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- collections
- ipywidgets
- tensorflow
- psutil
- gputil
- humanize
```
For example :

!pip3 install torch torchvision
!pip3 install pydrive --upgrade
!pip3 install tqdm
```
